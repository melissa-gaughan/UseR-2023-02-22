# UseR 2023-02-22 R at King County Metro

This repo was created for a presentation given to the Seattle UseR MeetUp group about how R is used to support analytics at King County Metro. The talk covered transit accessibility modeling using the r5R package and survey analysis using the Qualtrics package. A shiny app was also demo'd, which is available at https://king-county-metro.shinyapps.io/accessibility-demo/
